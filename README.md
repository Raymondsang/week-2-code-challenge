This program works as a shopping list.
To add content to the shopping list you click on the input box and press add after you finish typing.
For the items added to the list, you can cross them off (single line through) after picking them from shelves while shopping by pressing the left mouse key once.
You can also be able to permanently remove such items from the list by double clicking the left mouse key.
